#' ggmapStitch.
#'
#' The ggmap package offers downloading map tiles from a variety of
#' providers, but (at least for Google Maps) the maps are restricted to a maximum
#' size.  This package removes this restriction by providing a function to
#' construct maps for given bounding box and zoom level.
