Title: Arbitrarily large maps with ggmap
Version: 0.0-0.4
Authors@R: "Kirill MÃ¼ller <krlml+r@mailbox.org> [aut, cre]"
Description: The ggmap package offers downloading map tiles from a variety of
    providers, but (at least for Google Maps) the maps are restricted to a
    maximum size.  This package removes this restriction by providing a
    function to construct maps for given bounding box and zoom level.
Depends:
    R (>= 3.1.1)

    ggmap,
    mapproj,
